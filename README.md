## About the App:
- A simple GraphQL ordering app created with Spring Boot by following LinkedIn tutorial 'Spring with GraphQL' by Frank P Moley III.

## What is GraphQL?
> [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is an open‑source query language for APIs and a server‑side runtime. It provides a strongly‑typed schema to define relationships between data, making APIs more flexible and predictable. And it isn’t tied to a specific database or storage engine — it works with your existing code and data, making it easier to evolve APIs over time.

## Why GraphQL?
1. Fetch exactly what you need — nothing more, nothing less
  - Clients can specify the exact fields they want.
  - This avoids over-fetching (getting too much data) and under-fetching (needing multiple requests to get related data).

2. Single endpoint
  - Unlike REST (which often has many endpoints like /users, /users/:id/orders, etc.), GraphQL typically uses one endpoint for all queries and mutations.

3. Strongly typed schema
  - The schema acts as a contract between client and server, making APIs self-documenting and easier to validate and evolve safely.

4. Faster development and iteration
  - Frontend developers can modify queries without needing backend changes, as long as the data exists in the schema.
